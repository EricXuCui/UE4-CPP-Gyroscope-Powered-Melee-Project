We developed a project by using C++ on the Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) platform with gyroscope technology (Motion Sensors, n.d.) at its core, the gameâ€™s character movements are controlled. Through simple tilt or movement, players can execute slashes, stabs, blocks with shields, and more, with each action depleting energy reserves. Besides, it includes the RPC feature which is fully compatiable with multiplayer games!

Engine version: Unreal 4.26

IDE: Visual Studio 2019 C++ 

This project doesn't include any art resources! It only includes cpp source codes; Such as the character cpp file and header file.
